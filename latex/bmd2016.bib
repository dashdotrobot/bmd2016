@article{Guo2014b,
abstract = {Circular arches subjected to in-plane loading are restrained with discrete lateral bracings to improve their out-of-plane stabilities in many cases. The arch segment between two adjacent bracings may buckle out of plane if the effective length of the arch segment is sufficiently large. During out-of-plane buckling, adjacent arch segments may provide elastic restraints which increase the out-of-plane stability of the arch segment significantly. This paper is concerned with out-of-plane elastic buckling of circular arch segments with elastic end restraints. The analytical method for deriving the out-of-plane buckling loads of circular arches with equal rotational restraints or equal warping restraints at both ends is formulated. For the convenience of structural designers, simple approximate formulas for predicting the out-of-plane buckling loads of these arches are developed by the curve-fitting method. As for circular arches with unequal rotational restraints, the approximate formula for the buckling load of the arch with equal rotational restraints is modified with a reduction factor. Comparisons with the finite-element results and the analytical solutions show that the predictions by approximate formulas are sufficiently accurate. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.},
